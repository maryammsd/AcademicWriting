# Writing an Essay
Here are several guides on how to plan an essay and start writing it
1. A short guide to essay planning and structure (University of Birmingham)

## Suggested stages of essay planning:
1. Break down the task and figure out what you need to write about. In simple question, what the is the question ? Is it broad or general or requires detailed explanation? 
2. Mind map what you already know about it and identify some questions you have to guide you through the next step.
3. Research and try to find out the answer of your questions from relevant resources.
4. Identify the key points and organise them. Use mind map to find their relation, group them
5. Decide a logical order for the points and try to find out their relation and how you can build up the argument.

## The 'Rule of Three' strucuture:
- Say what you are going to say -> introduction
- Say it -> body
- Say what you have said -> conclusion

## The first and last sentences should indicate the main point of the paragraph and the last one should specify a summary and transition to the next paragraph.
