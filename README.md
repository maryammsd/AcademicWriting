# Writing-Research-Paper
In this repository, I will provide the materials and my notes on how to write a research paper or essay.


## Introduction: Introduce your work to readers!

## Related Work:

## Motivating Example:

## Overview:
If your work has several components, it is better to give an overview of them before going into details in this section. It is advised to use a figure to depict the components to give a big picture of your solution. This section represents a mind map for the reader before getting involved with details. There are some points that must be considered in writing this section:
- try to define the terminology used later in the manuscript
- add the assumptions about the work and conditions required
- explain the standards and the realisitic reasons for using the assumptions
- explain the solution in a chronological way

## Detailed Approach:
In this section, you should discuss the details of your approach in a way that the reader can reproduce your results. In order to do that, first explain why you use this solution, why the overall proposed key components fit together and then go into details. Do not explain the details without telling the reason behind you come up with them. 

A simple receipe for writing this section is:
+ start by explaing what this section is for 
+ tell the purpose 
+ how it fits with the overall aim
+ explain the details of your proposed solution
+ summarise what you alread discussed at the end

In computer science, this section might include either of a theorem or an algorithm. [add more information on how to write these two]

# Writing an Essay
Here are several guides on how to plan an essay and start writing it
1. A short guide to essay planning and structure (University of Birmingham)

## Suggested stages of essay planning:
1. Break down the task and figure out what you need to write about. In simple question, what the is the question ? Is it broad or general or requires detailed explanation? 
2. Mind map what you already know about it and identify some questions you have to guide you through the next step.
3. Research and try to find out the answer of your questions from relevant resources.
4. Identify the key points and organise them. Use mind map to find their relation, group them
5. Decide a logical order for the points and try to find out their relation and how you can build up the argument.

## The 'Rule of Three' strucuture:
- Say what you are going to say -> introduction
- Say it -> body
- Say what you have said -> conclusion

## The first and last sentences should indicate the main point of the paragraph and the last one should specify a summary and transition to the next paragraph.
