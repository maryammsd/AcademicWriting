# Writing-Research-Paper
In this repository, I will provide the materials and my notes on how to write a research paper or essay.


## Introduction: Introduce your work to readers!

## Related Work:

## Motivating Example:

## Overview:
If your work has several components, it is better to give an overview of them before going into details in this section. It is advised to use a figure to depict the components to give a big picture of your solution. This section represents a mind map for the reader before getting involved with details. There are some points that must be considered in writing this section:
- try to define the terminology used later in the manuscript
- add the assumptions about the work and conditions required
- explain the standards and the realisitic reasons for using the assumptions
- explain the solution in a chronological way

## Detailed Approach:
In this section, you should discuss the details of your approach in a way that the reader can reproduce your results. In order to do that, first explain why you use this solution, why the overall proposed key components fit together and then go into details. Do not explain the details without telling the reason behind you come up with them. 

A simple receipe for writing this section is:
+ start by explaing what this section is for 
+ tell the purpose 
+ how it fits with the overall aim
+ explain the details of your proposed solution
+ summarise what you alread discussed at the end

In computer science, this section might include either of a theorem or an algorithm. [add more information on how to write these two]
